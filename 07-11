    -> 
    -> To achieve the desired functionality, we need to create a trigger that will automatically insert 3 prizes for each new event that is added to the Event table. The three prizes will be:
    -> 
    ->     1st prize with a money value of 1500
    ->     2nd prize with a money value of 1000
    ->     3rd prize with a money value of 500
    -> 
    -> Hereâ€™s how you can implement this trigger in SQL:
    -> Step 1: Create the required tables
    -> 
    -> First, let's define the Event, Participant, Prizes, and Winners tables as per the schema you provided.
